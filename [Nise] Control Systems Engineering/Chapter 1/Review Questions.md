# Review Questions - Chapter 1

1. Hard Disk Drive, Airplane Autopilot, Elevator
2. PRO: They monitor output, they react to changes in the environment, they ensure a stable state is reached. CON: They are more expensive and complicated.
3. Toaster with measuring how burnt a bread is,  the flush and how clean the toilet is, the washing machine and how clean the clothes are.
4. The output is measured and compared with the input (expected output).
5. There is noise from the environment in the measurment.
6. It is called the actuating signal.
7. Many systems controlled by one computer. The parameters can be changed without physical alterations.
8. Transient response, stady-state error, stability.
9. Natural Response + Forced Response.
10. The system oscilates uncontrollably.
11. Part of the natural response.
12. Represent the physical system as a schematic, use the scematic to obtain mathematical model, reduce the block diagram, analyze system to find stability, transient response and steady-state performance.
13. Determine a physical system and specifications from requirements, draw a functional block diagram, represent the system as a schematic, use the scematic to obtain mathematical model, reduce the block diagram, analyze and design the system to meet specified requirements and specifications find stability, transient response and steady-state performance.
14. True.
15. Differential Equations, Transfer Function, State-Space Representation.
16. Differential Equations: Differential equations that relates the output with the input. Transfer Function: Laplace transformation of the Differential Equations. State-Space Representation: Turns a n-th order differential equation into n first order differential equations.
